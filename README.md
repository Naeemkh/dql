## Deep Double Q-learning

![DQlearning Demo](figures/animation_20201003101019.gif)


In this project, Deep Q-learning and Double Deep Q-learning algorithms are implemented to collect gold nuggets and deliver them to predefined storage. The domain is a 2-dimensional maze. The following figure shows an example of the domain and its features.

  <figcaption>Example of the project environment. Cubeâ€™s color definition is represented on the right. The agent (red cube) is allowed to normal moves. The color of the agent turns green (not shown in the domain) upon collecting a gold. See the text for more details.</figcaption>

The agent learns the optimal policy by the DDQL algorithm. The following table shows the immediate rewards for the agent actions. 


|                             Action                                |  Reward | 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Hitting the borders                                               |   -1.00 |
| Hitting the blocks(walls)                                         |   -1.00 |
| Wandering around                                                  |   -0.05 |
| Entering a cube with gold while the agent has gold                |   -0.05 |
| Entering a cube with gold while the agent does not have the gold  |   +1.00 |
| Entering storage while the agent has gold                         |   +1.00 |
| Entering storage while the agent does not have gold               |   -0.20 |
