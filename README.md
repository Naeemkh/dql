![DQlearning Demo](figures/animation_20201003101019.gif)


In this project, Deep Q-learning and Double Deep Q-learning algorithms are implemented to collect gold nuggets and deliver them to predefined storage. The domain is a 2-dimensional maze. The following figure shows an example of the domain and its features.
